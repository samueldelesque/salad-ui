The curried function has two unusual capabilities.\n\t     * First, its arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is\n\t     * `R.curryN(3, f)`, the following are equivalent:\n\t     *\n\t     *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t     *\n\t     * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\n\t     * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\n\t     * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`,\n\t     * the following are equivalent:\n\t     *\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.5.0\n\t     * @category Function\n\t     * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t     * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n\t     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t     * @see R.curry\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n\t     *\n\t     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n\t     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t     *      var g = f(3);\n\t     *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t     */\n\t    var curryN = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n\t        if (length === 1) {\n\t            return _curry1(fn);\n\t        }\n\t        return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Decrements its argument.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.9.0\n\t     * @category Math\n\t     * @sig Number -> Number\n\t     * @param {Number} n\n\t     * @return {Number}\n\t     * @see R.inc\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      R.dec(42); //=> 41\n\t     */\n\t    var dec = add(-1);\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns the second argument if it is not `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`\n\t     * otherwise the first argument is returned.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.10.0\n\t     * @category Logic\n\t     * @sig a -> b -> a | b\n\t     * @param {a} val The default value.\n\t     * @param {b} val The value to return if it is not null or undefined\n\t     * @return {*} The the second value or the default value\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      var defaultTo42 = R.defaultTo(42);\n\t     *\n\t     *      defaultTo42(null);  //=> 42\n\t     *      defaultTo42(undefined);  //=> 42\n\t     *      defaultTo42('Ramda');  //=> 'Ramda'\n\t     *      defaultTo42(parseInt('string')); //=> 42\n\t     */\n\t    var defaultTo = _curry2(function defaultTo(d, v) {\n\t        return v == null || v !== v ? d : v;\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Finds the set (i.e. no duplicates) of all elements in the first list not contained in the second list.\n\t     * Duplication is determined according to the value returned by applying the supplied predicate to two list\n\t     * elements.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.1.0\n\t     * @category Relation\n\t     * @sig (a,a -> Boolean) -> [a] -> [a] -> [a]\n\t     * @param {Function} pred A predicate used to test whether two items are equal.\n\t     * @param {Array} list1 The first list.\n\t     * @param {Array} list2 The second list.\n\t     * @see R.difference\n\t     * @return {Array} The elements in `list1` that are not in `list2`.\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      function cmp(x, y) => x.a === y.a;\n\t     *      var l1 = [{a: 1}, {a: 2}, {a: 3}];\n\t     *      var l2 = [{a: 3}, {a: 4}];\n\t     *      R.differenceWith(cmp, l1, l2); //=> [{a: 1}, {a: 2}]\n\t     */\n\t    var differenceWith = _curry3(function differenceWith(pred, first, second) {\n\t        var out = [];\n\t        var idx = 0;\n\t        var firstLen = first.length;\n\t        var containsPred = containsWith(pred);\n\t        while (idx < firstLen) {\n\t            if (!containsPred(first[idx], second) && !containsPred(first[idx], out)) {\n\t                out[out.length] = first[idx];\n\t            }\n\t            idx += 1;\n\t        }\n\t        return out;\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns a new object that does not contain a `prop` property.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.10.0\n\t     * @category Object\n\t     * @sig String -> {k: v} -> {k: v}\n\t     * @param {String} prop the name of the property to dissociate\n\t     * @param {Object} obj the object to clone\n\t     * @return {Object} a new object similar to the original but without the specified property\n\t     * @see R.assoc\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      R.dissoc('b', {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}); //=> {a: 1, c: 3}\n\t     */\n\t    var dissoc = _curry2(function dissoc(prop, obj) {\n\t        var result = {};\n\t        for (var p in obj) {\n\t            if (p !== prop) {\n\t                result[p] = obj[p];\n\t            }\n\t        }\n\t        return result;\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Makes a shallow clone of an object, omitting the property at the\n\t     * given path.

The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed invocations. Provide an options object to indicate that `func`\n * should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout.\n * Subsequent calls to the debounced function return the result of the last\n * `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the the debounced function is\n * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false] Specify invoking on the leading\n *  edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait] The maximum time `func` is allowed to be\n *  delayed before it is invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true] Specify invoking on the trailing\n *  edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // invoke `sendMail` when the click event is fired, debouncing subsequent calls\n * jQuery('#postbox').on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', _.debounce(batchLog, 250, {\n *   'maxWait': 1000\n * }));\n *\n * // cancel a debounced call\n * var todoChanges = _.debounce(batchLog, 1000);\n * Object.observe(models.todo, todoChanges);\n *\n * Object.observe(models, function(changes) {\n *   if (_.find(changes, { 'user': 'todo', 'type': 'delete'})) {\n *     todoChanges.cancel();\n *   }\n * }, ['delete']);\n *\n * // ...at some point `models.todo` is changed\n * models.todo.completed = true;\n *\n * // ...before 1 second has passed `models.todo` is deleted\n * // which cancels the debounced `todoChanges` call\n * delete models.todo;\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var args,\n      maxTimeoutId,\n      result,\n      stamp,\n      thisArg,\n      timeoutId,\n      trailingCall,\n      lastCalled = 0,\n      maxWait = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = wait < 0 ? 0 : (+wait || 0);\n  if (options === true) {\n    var leading = true;\n    trailing = false;\n  } else if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxWait = 'maxWait' in options && nativeMax(+options.maxWait || 0, wait);\n    trailing = 'trailing' in options ? !!options.trailing : trailing;\n  }\n\n  function cancel() {\n    if (timeoutId) {\n      clearTimeout(timeoutId);\n    }\n    if (maxTimeoutId) {\n      clearTimeout(maxTimeoutId);\n    }\n    lastCalled = 0;\n    maxTimeoutId = timeoutId = trailingCall = undefined;\n  }\n\n  function complete(isCalled, id) {\n    if (id) {\n      clearTimeout(id);\n    }\n    maxTimeoutId = timeoutId = trailingCall = undefined;\n    if (isCalled) {\n      lastCalled = now();\n      result = func.apply(thisArg, args);\n      if (!timeoutId && !maxTimeoutId) {\n        args = thisArg = undefined;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  function delayed() {\n    var remaining = wait -
